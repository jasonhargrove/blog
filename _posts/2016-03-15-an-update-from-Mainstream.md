![Bracelets of Power]({{ page.shareImage }})

Been building relationships since our last update with a number of brands via our passion project [Shoots Official](https://twitter.com/ShootsOfficial), making fashion images üì∑üì∏

And have started on publishers, too. üëóüìëüìñ

Meanwhile, our [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gomainstream) continues to do upwards of 50,000 views every single day, feeding our ongoing research üçî. Passion, passion, passion üçé

Jason‚Äôs been playing [Kanye West](https://twitter.com/kanyewest), pretty much on repeat. Mostly ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy‚Äù, which he loves; but Throne & Pablo too üé∂

He‚Äôs building the front of our MVP (minimum viable product) in Facebook‚Äôs [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), moving away from his longtime love [Angular](https://angularjs.org).

üéπ This pretty much sums up where our heads are at this week:

const rightElements = [length + ' image' + ((length > 1) ? 's' : '') + ' selected', <button>Use</button>];

Plus, it‚Äôs [Toronto Fashion Week](http://toronto-fashionweek.com), and Alanna's pushing out George Pimentel‚Äôs photos to the world. (Alongside a few other Weeks.)

And other things going on that are big, and intense, and worthy of much internal angst. All positive though. All growth. All team.

Anyway! Hard at work. Hard at work. Catch up soon ‚ù§Ô∏è
