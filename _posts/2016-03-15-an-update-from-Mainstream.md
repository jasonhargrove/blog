Been building relationships since our last update with a number of brands via our passion project [Shoots Official](https://twitter.com/ShootsOfficial), making fashion images 📷📸

And have started on publishers, too. 👗📑📖

Meanwhile, our [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gomainstream) continues to do upwards of 50,000 views every single day, feeding our ongoing research 🍔. Passion, passion, passion 🍎

Jason’s been playing [Kanye West](https://twitter.com/kanyewest), pretty much on repeat. Mostly “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”, which he loves; but Throne & Pablo too 🎶

He’s building the front of our MVP (minimum viable product) in Facebook’s [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), moving away from his longtime love [Angular](https://angularjs.org).

<span>🎹&nbsp;&nbsp;This pretty much sums up where our heads are at this week:</span>

> const rightElements = [length + ' image' + ((length > 1) ? 's' : '') + ' selected', &#60;button&#62;Use&#60;/button&#62;];

Plus, it’s [Toronto Fashion Week](http://toronto-fashionweek.com), and Alanna's pushing out George Pimentel’s photos to the world. (Alongside a few other Weeks.)

And other things going on that are big, and intense, and worthy of much internal angst. All positive though. All growth. All team.

<span>Anyway! Hard at work. Hard at work. Catch up soon &#10084;</span>
