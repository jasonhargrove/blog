Been a while, ðŸ¤”. Hi! ðŸ˜€

Jason took a detour from Mainstream to work on a tech fashion product, launched worldwide, for a well known brand. Success! He's back now ðŸ¤—

My name is Alanna Joanne. With Jason I founded a photography studio called Shoots ([@shootsofficial](https://twitter.com/shootsofficial)). FUN! Turns out, we work well together.

Mainstream is a software service for the publishing industry, conceived at fashion weeks and film festivals.

The 1st private beta was developed with a team of developers in the heart of Paris. Then, a 2nd was developed at [@csiSL](https://twitter.com/csiSL) in New York.

Both failed to launch, but each provided incredible experiences and knowledge; and a host of assets. Today, we're working on the 3rd round.

And we're going to launch it! ðŸš€

Yes, co-founders! With real enthusiasm, we've been working on a freshly focused product, a new blog, and have started pitching industry.

While we'll keep the product details quiet until we begin selling in New York and Toronto this Spring, we're opening up about our process. ðŸ“–

On our blog, we'll begin by sharing our technical details. Sure, for tech folk, but mostly for the publishing world. 

So, stay tuned! What we share may help other budding entrepreneurs, or those who want to be more tech savvy.

We'll do our best to stay active. And to make it fun. Whether we succeed or fail, for sure, we'll have fun. Let's do this guys!

Sincerely,  
[Alanna](https://twitter.com/alannajoanne11) and [Jason](https://twitter.com/jasonhargrove)
