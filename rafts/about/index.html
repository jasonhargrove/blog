    <blockquote>
  <p>Who is Shoots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots Official is a private, non-commercial creative production studio focused on fashion photography and film. Our core team is made up of four members.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does Shoots do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots produces high-quality mainstream and creative fashion photoshoots.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is Shoots located?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots is based in Toronto, Ontario and we shoot out of a private, well-equipped studio in the Financial District.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did Shoots begin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots was inspired by Director/Photographer Jason Hargrove’s desire to stay active and relevant in fashion while continuing his career in tech, and doing so in a way that was motivated by passion not money.</p>

<p>Shoots is a product of our team’s collective love for fashion, creativity and collaboration.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When does Shoots shoot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots is a high value, high focus part-time project. We will be shooting every two weeks from February to June, 2016.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is Shoots funded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots is funded by Jason Hargrove.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How long has Shoots been shooting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots has been shooting since September 2015. Our Photographer Jason Hargrove has been actively shooting since 2006 and since 2011 has been focused in fashion.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is Shoots’ purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shoots exists to produce great fashion creative, for the sake of that alone. However, we do have strong goals for publishing.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who are the creatives on your team?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason Hargrove is our Creative Director and Photographer. He writes for us too.</p>

<p>Julia Crimson is our Hair &amp; Makeup Artist.</p>

<p>Alanna Joanne (Producer) is one of our Writers.</p>

<p>Maria Rubio (Assistant Producer) also contributes as a model.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will models be paid for their time with Shoots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are all <em>volunteers</em>, working to produce great creative. Our models are co-owners in that creative.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will the model receive high-resolution photos from Shoots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our Producers distribute all high-resolution photos via Dropbox links. We also share these images on our social channels and encourage the models to engage with us.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does Shoots aspire to become a large-scale production?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our current intentions are to stay small with our creative and passion-based fundamentals.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the Creative Direction for Shoots Season 2?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Season we are shooting mainstream Spring-Summer 2016 fashion, influenced by pop-rock icons such as David Bowie, Lady Gaga, Bjork, etc.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does Shoots shoot lingerie or swimwear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We shoot full-length fashion looks and are typically not interested in lingerie or 			swimwear.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Shoots models need to provide their own clothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the model’s own undergarments, all looks on set are styled and provided by the Shoots Style Team.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is Shoots open to collaborations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of our core values is collaboration and we love connecting with like-minded creatives in the industry.</p>

<p><br />
